# Instructions  
## FizzBuzz

Write a `fizzbuzz()` function that takes in a number, `n`, and prints out the numbers from 1 to `n`. 

For **multiples of three**, replace the number with the word `"Fizz"`, and for the **multiples of five**, replace the number with the word `"Buzz"`. 

For numbers that are **multiples of both three and five**, use `"FizzBuzz"` (capitalization matters).

For example, `fizzbuzz(16)` should print:
`1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', 16`


*You don't need to have them separated by commas; you can have each number (or word) get printed on it's own line*
